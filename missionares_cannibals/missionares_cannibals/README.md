The Problem:
The missionaries and cannibals problem is usually stated as follows. Three mission-
aries and three cannibals are on one side of a river, along with a boat that can hold one or two
people. Find a way to get everyone to the other side, without ever leaving a group of rnis-
sionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that place. This problem is famous in
A1 because it was the subject of the first paper that approached problem formulation from an
analytical viewpoint (Amarel, 1968).

Solution:

To execute code on terminal
    Run:
    python main.py 3 3 2 (for windows)
    python3 main.py 3 3 2 (for Linux)

    3 missionaries , 3 cannibals , 2 boat capacity

Outputs:
The outputs are at the same folder . For BFS -> out_BFS.txt 
                                     For DFS -> out_DFS.txt

Also at terminal we see the noumber of explored nodes  

DFS is better.

This implementation is able to deal with a scaled-up version of this problem (for example, a problem with five missionaries and five cannibals)
